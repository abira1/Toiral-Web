# Toiral Web Application Security Implementation Plan

This document outlines the phased approach for implementing comprehensive security measures in the Toiral web application.

## Phase 1: Foundation Security (Immediate Implementation)

### Database Security Rules
- ✅ Implement proper authentication checks for all database paths
- ✅ Add data validation rules to prevent malformed or malicious data
- ✅ Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types
- ✅ Set up proper indexing for optimized queries

### Authentication System
- ✅ Enhance password requirements and validation
- ✅ Implement secure login flows with rate limiting
- ✅ Add Google authentication with proper security measures
- ✅ Create secure password reset functionality

### Data Protection
- ✅ Implement client-side encryption for sensitive data
- ✅ Create validation service for input sanitization
- ✅ Set up permissions context for granular access control
- ✅ Create protected route component for secure navigation

### Security Monitoring
- ✅ Implement security logging for authentication events
- ✅ Add suspicious activity detection
- ✅ Create rate limiting service to prevent abuse
- ✅ Set up basic threat detection for common attack patterns

## Phase 2: Enhanced Security (1-2 Weeks)

### User Management
- [ ] Implement email verification for new accounts
- [ ] Add multi-factor authentication (MFA) option
- [ ] Create account recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Implement session management with secure timeouts

### Advanced Data Protection
- [ ] Set up server-side data validation
- [ ] Implement data integrity checks
- [ ] Create backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Add data anonymization for analytics

### Security Hardening
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [ ] Add HTTP security headers
- [ ] Set up CORS configuration
- [ ] Implement XSS and CSRF protection

### Monitoring and Alerting
- [ ] Create admin security dashboard
- [ ] Set up real-time security alerts
- [ ] Implement automated threat response
- [ ] Add audit logging for sensitive operations

## Phase 3: Comprehensive Security (2-4 Weeks)

### Advanced Authentication
- [ ] Implement passwordless authentication options
- [ ] Add biometric authentication support
- [ ] Create risk-based authentication flows
- [ ] Implement secure API authentication

### Data Governance
- [ ] Create data retention policies
- [ ] Implement data classification
- [ ] Set up data access auditing
- [ ] Add privacy controls for user data

### Compliance
- [ ] Implement GDPR compliance features
- [ ] Add cookie consent management
- [ ] Create privacy policy and terms of service
- [ ] Set up data subject access request handling

### Security Testing
- [ ] Implement automated security testing
- [ ] Conduct penetration testing
- [ ] Set up vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Create security incident response plan

## Implementation Guidelines

### Database Security Rules
- Always test rules in the Firebase Rules Playground before deployment
- Use the principle of least privilege for all access controls
- Implement data validation for all write operations
- Use indexing for frequently queried paths

### Authentication
- Never store passwords in plaintext
- Always use secure password hashing
- Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- Use secure, HttpOnly cookies for session management

### Data Protection
- Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Validate all user inputs on both client and server
- Sanitize data to prevent injection attacks
- Implement proper error handling to avoid information leakage

### Security Monitoring
- Log all security-relevant events
- Monitor for suspicious activity patterns
- Implement rate limiting for all public endpoints
- Set up alerts for security incidents

## Security Best Practices

### General Security
- Keep all dependencies up to date
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Implement defense in depth
- Conduct regular security reviews

### Code Security
- Use static code analysis tools
- Follow secure coding guidelines
- Conduct code reviews with security focus
- Avoid using deprecated or vulnerable libraries

### Operational Security
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper error handling
- Set up secure deployment processes
- Create backup and disaster recovery procedures

### User Education
- Provide clear security guidelines for users
- Implement secure password requirements
- Educate users about phishing and social engineering
- Provide account security options (MFA, session management)

## Security Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Verify authorization controls
- [ ] Check input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Test for common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, injection)
- [ ] Verify secure communication (HTTPS)
- [ ] Check error handling and logging
- [ ] Test rate limiting and abuse prevention
- [ ] Verify data encryption
